I am currently working as a postdoc in Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arobr. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. I am also very interested in the applications and developments of molecular dynamics simulation. You can find a detailed list of my published works in my [CV](/CV3.pdf). In brief, the research topics that I have explored include the following:

- Electronic structure of alloy thin film on semiconductor substrate.

- Creases/cracks/punctures on a paper sheet, paper roll, or aluminum foil.

- Crumpling of two different materials.

- Acoustic emission from breaking bamboo chopsticks.

- Scaling structure of a corpus.

- Develop useful kinetic map for molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling techniques.

- Nucleation

I have research experience in both designing experiments and developing computational methods. I am especially proud of the fact that some of my designs are frequently used by my previous and current colleagues, helping them produce lots of great papers. The most frequently used ones worth mentioning are the following:

Fracturing machine:

The experiments inspired by this designs can be found in the following papers

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)

- [Phase Diagram and Snap-Off Transition for a Twisted Party Balloon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08739)

We've also thought about using it to measure the crack development on paper

The crease energy analysis tool I developed are used in the following papers

- [Crumpling an elastoplastic thin sphere](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.012209)

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)
