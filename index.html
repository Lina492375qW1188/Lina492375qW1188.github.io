    I am currently working as a postdoc in Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arobr. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. I am also very interested in the applications and developments of molecular dynamics simulation. You can find a detailed list of my published works in my <a href="/CV3.pdf">CV</a>.
