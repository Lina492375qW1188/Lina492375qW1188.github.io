I am currently working as a postdoc in Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arobr. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. I am also very interested in the applications and developments of molecular dynamics simulation. You can find a detailed list of my published works in my <a href="/CV3.pdf">CV</a>. In brief, the research topics that I have explored include the following:

<br>- Electronic structure of alloy thin film on semiconductor substrate.</br>

<br>- Creases/cracks/punctures on a paper sheet, paper roll, or aluminum foil.</br>

<br>- Crumpling of two different materials.</br>

<br>- Acoustic emission from breaking bamboo chopsticks.</br>

<br>- Scaling structure of a corpus.</br>

<br>- Develop useful kinetic map for molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling techniques.</br>

<br>- Nucleation</br>
