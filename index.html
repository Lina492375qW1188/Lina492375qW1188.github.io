I am currently working as a postdoc in Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arobr. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. I am also very interested in the applications and developments of molecular dynamics simulation. You can find a detailed list of my published works in my [CV](/CV3.pdf). In brief, the research topics that I have explored include the following:

- Electronic structure of alloy thin film on semiconductor substrate.

- Creases/cracks/punctures on a paper sheet, paper roll, or aluminum foil.

- Crumpling of two different materials.

- Acoustic emission from breaking bamboo chopsticks.

- Scaling structure of a corpus.

- Develop useful kinetic map for molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling techniques.

- Nucleation
