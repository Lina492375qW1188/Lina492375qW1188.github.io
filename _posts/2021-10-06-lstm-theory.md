This is the notes of our failed approaches to the theory of recently published Nat. commu. paper. The only believe we had at that time is that LSTM must store certain kinetic information and the embedding space should represent a type of kinetic map. We tried to differentiate the loss function at the very begining and hoped to get a closer look into even a little understanding to the internal processes of LSTM. We'd also thought about building an inverse map of loss function and explaining it through a fake intermediate loss. It was almost written onto overleaf for a substitute approach.

I have many thanks to En-Jui Kuo, who work a lot with me on this theory for several months, simply because we both have curiosity, passion, and eager to knowledge. The world is so large. Many people are working on phenomenal things; yet we were struggling for answering a question which we could not answer at that time in a small place.
