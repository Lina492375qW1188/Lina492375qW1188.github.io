Experiments I've designed and worked with at NTHU

The experiments inspired by these designs can be found in the following papers

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)

- [Phase Diagram and Snap-Off Transition for a Twisted Party Balloon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08739)

- [Crumpling an elastoplastic thin sphere](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.012209)

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)
