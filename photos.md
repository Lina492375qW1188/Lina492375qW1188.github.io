Besides developing computational methods, I also designed experiments. The apparaus I've designed had been used by my previous and current colleagues in their great work, indcluding:

Fracturing machine:

The experiments inspired by this designs can be found in the following papers

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)

- [Phase Diagram and Snap-Off Transition for a Twisted Party Balloon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08739)

We've also thought about using it to measure the crack development on paper

The crease energy analysis tool I developed are used in the following papers

- [Crumpling an elastoplastic thin sphere](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.012209)

- [Crumpling-origami transition for twisting cylindrical shells](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053001)
