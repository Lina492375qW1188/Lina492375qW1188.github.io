I am a Physics PhD student at University of Maryland, College park. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. You can find a detailed list of my published works in my [CV](/CV3.pdf) or [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=e0BF_m8AAAAJ). In brief, the research topics that I have explored include the following:

- Electronic structure of alloy thin film on semiconductor substrate.

- Creases/cracks/punctures on a paper sheet, paper roll, or aluminum foil.

- Crumpling of two different materials.

- Acoustic emission from breaking bamboo chopsticks.

- Scaling structure of a corpus.
