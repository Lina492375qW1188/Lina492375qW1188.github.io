I am a Physics PhD student at University of Maryland, College park. My research focus is mostly in soft condensed matter and its dynamics. You can find my published work in my CV or Google scholar. My previous work includes the following:

* Electronic structure of alloy thin film on semiconductor substrate.
* Creases/cracks/punctures on a paper sheet, paper roll, or aluminum foil.
* Crumpling of two different materials.
* Acoustic emission from breaking bamboo chopsticks.
* Scaling structure of a corpus.
